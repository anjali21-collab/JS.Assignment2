The objective of this project is to create a Calculator Application that demonstrates the concept of Method Overloading in Java. The application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using overloaded methods with different data types and parameters.

This project successfully demonstrates the use of Method Overloading in Java through a simple Calculator Application. It helped in understanding how one method name can handle multiple types of parameters and perform different operations. The project also improved knowledge of object-oriented concepts, exception handling, and control structures.
